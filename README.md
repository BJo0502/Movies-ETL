# Module 8: Movies-ETL

## Overview
The intent of this project is to create an automated pipeline for Amazing Prime that takes in new movie related date from multiple sources and preforms an ETL process on the raw input data. In order to ensure a consistent ETL process, we have created a complex function so that all we will need to do in the future is import the new files as variable. After the data has gone through the ETL process, it is loaded and stored into a PostgresSQL database.
